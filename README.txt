 * an 'out1opt.txt' (which has the optimal phase 1 tableu)
 * an 'out2ini.txt' (which has the initial phase 2 tableu)
 * an 'out2opt.txt' (which has the optimal phase 2 tableu)
 * 
 * If there is no input.txt Program will throw FileNotFoundException !!!

 			There should be exactly one empty line between each section just as the way in example input file
